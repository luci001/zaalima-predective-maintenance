Predictive Maintenance for Manufacturing
##Goal##
The goal of this project is to predict machinery failures before they occur using machine learning techniques. This helps reduce unplanned downtime, optimize maintenance schedules, and improve overall operational efficiency in manufacturing environments.

##Problem Statement##
Unplanned equipment failures in manufacturing can lead to:
Expensive production stoppages
Increased maintenance costs
Reduced equipment lifespan
This project leverages sensor data and machine learning to predict when machinery is likely to fail, allowing maintenance teams to take proactive actions.

##Dataset##
The dataset contains time-series sensor readings from industrial machines, typically including:
Temperature
Pressure
Vibration
Rotation speed
Failure indicators (labels)
Note: A publicly available dataset like NASA’s turbofan engine degradation or any simulated dataset can be used.

##Techniques Used##
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Engineering (Rolling stats, lags, etc.)
Data Preprocessing (Imputation, normalization)
Machine Learning Models:
Random Forest
XGBoost
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
Model Interpretability (e.g., SHAP values)
